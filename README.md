Data visualization using baby activity data collected by my wife on my 6 month old baby from an app called Baby Tracker: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amila.parenting&hl=en&gl=US

Output can be viewed here: https://twitter.com/ZanderVenter6/status/1478110790276235268

Due to time constraints (aka a baby ;-)) I have not annotated the code well but am posting it here in case it can be of use to others.
